# About
This is a server code with multiple TCP connections for a group of clients, where the transfer and receipt of a file from the opposite client or server occurs as a continuous stream in a separate connection (FTP server) in C#. The client itself is also implemented in WPF with MaterialDesignInXAML.
The version with MaterialDesignInXAML is in the brandNewDesign branch. The master branch uses classic XAML.
